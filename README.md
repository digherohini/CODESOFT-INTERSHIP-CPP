C++ Projects - Codesoft Internship
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the projects I developed during my internship at Codesoft. This internship provided me with an opportunity to deepen my knowledge of C++ by developing a range of projects, from basic applications to more complex systems.

Projects Overview
1. Simple Calculator
A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It was an excellent project to reinforce fundamental concepts such as functions, user input handling, and switch-case statements.

Key Concepts:

Arithmetic operations using functions
Input/output handling
Switch-case statements
2. Number Guessing Game
An interactive game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. This project helped me enhance my understanding of loops, conditional logic, and random number generation in C++.

Key Concepts:

Loops (while, for)
Conditional logic (if-else)
Random number generation
User input/output handling
3. Library Management System
A system to manage a libraryâ€™s collection of books, including functionalities such as adding, deleting, and searching for books. This project gave me experience with file handling, data storage, and user interface design in a console environment.

Key Concepts:

File handling (read/write operations)
Structs and classes for data organization
Searching, adding, and deleting records
User input validation
Tools & Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++
IDE: Code::Blocks / Visual Studio
Version Control: Git & GitHub
How to Run the Projects
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-codesoft-internship
Navigate to the project folder.
Compile and run the project using your preferred C++ compiler. Example with g++:
bash
Copy code
g++ simple_calculator.cpp -o simple_calculator
./simple_calculator
Skills Gained
Proficient use of C++ for solving real-world problems
Strong understanding of file handling and data management
Experience with building interactive applications
Enhanced debugging and problem-solving skills
Conclusion
This internship at Codesoft was a great experience where I developed important C++ programming skills. The projects in this repository reflect the variety of challenges I tackled, and I look forward to working on more advanced projects in the future.

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback or suggestions!
